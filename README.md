# Speaker Selector

The purpose of this project was to create and develop a speaker switch system that will allow to redirect the output of an existant home audio system to specific zones of a house. 

## The problem
The existing audio system in place allows the user to control speaker in 3 different zones of the house, each zone being connected to multiple speakers. However, this 3-zone separation is not sufficient for big houses where multiple isolated sections are present. 

To solve this, a microcontroller based relay system was used. This system separates each zone from the original audio system into subzones linked to one or multiple speakers. For this reason, this system only works with an already existing audio system and the main control of the audio is done with the original sound system.
